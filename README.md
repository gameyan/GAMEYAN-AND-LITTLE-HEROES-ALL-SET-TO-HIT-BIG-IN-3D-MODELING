# GAMEYAN-AND-LITTLE-HEROES-ALL-SET-TO-HIT-BIG-IN-3D-MODELING

Steve Jobs once said that “Great things in business are never done by one person; they’re done by a team of people”. And Little Heroes (Pequenos Heroes), the first Venezuelan 3D animation feature film, is a classic example of this. Inception of this project started in the year 2012 when the Venezuelan production company Orinoco Films decided to make a movie about the feats of Simon Bolivar, a South American hero. Director Juan Pablo Buscarini, historian Carmen Bohorquez and screen writer Enrique Cortes formed a team and rigorously started working on it.

Just like any other competent leader, director Buscarini wanted the best for his movie. Instead of limiting themselves to the boundaries of South America, the team members reached out to the world. Their hard work paid off when they went on to hire character creator 3d and 3d animators services from the experts across eight countries, which allowed them to have the best people working for Little Heroes. India made it to their list along with Argentina, Venezuela, UK, USA, Serbia, Spain and Hong Kong.

But, the breathtaking moment for GameYan (the brand of Yantram Studio) came when it was selected to be a part of the movie’s production. The challenge was tough but, the horizon of opportunities it showed to GameYan’s team propelled them to give their best. Without any delay, the game development production studio and Animated Character Creation put their best foot forward and engaged 25 highly-skilled professionals. The team successfully completed 3D Character Development (3D modeling, texturing and rigging and simulation) of around 250  characters.

Feature film Production of Little Heroes has finally come to the end, and the entire cast and crew is eagerly waiting for its premiere. What makes it special does not just include the fact that the movie stars the very famous Patricia Velasquez for the voice of Pilar, one of the protagonists. The movie stands out in technical terms too as it is the first South American animated movie which has used MoCap technique. The motion capturing animation for the movie has been done by Centroid.


Little Heroes (Pequenos Heroes) – The Story  Arturo, Tico and Pilar are three children who come from different backgrounds. On one fine morning, when the day seemed as usual bright and exuberant, the three discovered a secret. For these brave children, size didn’t matter.

Amidst all the adventures, a great bonding between the kids takes place.  <br>
